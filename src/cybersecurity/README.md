In this directory, I keep all the scripts and tools I have used for cybersecurity (no matter it's in the context of
python or any other programming languages that I am proficient in.)

here is a list of what I have done in here so far:

<ol>
<li>Used the <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography">cryptography</a> library for making a simple encryption engine. </li>

The <b>cryptography</b> library is nice and easy to use but the main problem is it's a pain to install this package on windows.
